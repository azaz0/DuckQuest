# DuckQuest
---

>You are given N rubber ducks that need to be arranged in a row. Each duck has a specified height and width. We need to arrange the ducks in such a way that the sum of the heights of the used ducks is as large as possible, and their total width does not exceed the maximum width of the row.

>Input: In the first row of the standard input, there are two integers N, M (1 <= N, M <= 50) separated by single spaces, denoting respectively: the number of available ducks and the maximum width of the row. In each subsequent N row, there are two integers w, s (1 <= w, s <=9) separated by a single space indicating the height (w) and width (s) of the duck. Output: Your program should print the maximum available sum of the heights of the used ducks for arranging them in a row on the standard output.

>Output: Your program should print the maximum available sum of the heights of the used ducks for arranging them in a row on the standard output.
